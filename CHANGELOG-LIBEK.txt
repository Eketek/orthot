  Remove the forward vector calculation from the plotter (plot.js), convert it into a utility function, and place it in direction.js
    (for re-use with planar picking)
  Invert the interior NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, and WEST positioning & orientation data used by setOrientation() (direction.js)
    (Fixes an error that became evident after putting it to use for the first time)
  Add flags to loadMuch() and loadZIP() (libek.js) to indicate whether or not newly loaded objects should override existing objects.
  Add function "deepcopy" to util.js  ( recursively copies properties from a source object to a new object )
