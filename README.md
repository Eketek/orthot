Orthot is a 3-dimensional puzzle game.  It is similar in concept to games like, Sokoban and Chip's Challenge, but adds an extra dimension, in addition to its own variety of interactive puzzle elements.  

The game consists of a collection of puzzles.  Each puzzle is constructed out of 3d blocks.  The goal in each puzzle is to reach a marked end position.  The challenge in each puzzle varies: they may inbolbe mazes, tests of skill/memory, logical problems, or whatever else a puzzle designer comes up with.

Orthot 3 is a successor to a discontinued commercial project which has since been made available free of charge.  It may be found at this address:
