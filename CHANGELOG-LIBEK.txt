  Replaced BoxTerrain surface MergeWith with MergeClass
    Borders between adjacent coplanar tiles (faces of cubes) are based on the MergeClass of a surface.  If two tiles share the same MergeClass,
    then the border is drawn around the tiles.  If two tiles have a differeing MergeClass, then borders will be drawn between them.
    If no MergeClass or the "auto" MergeClass is specified, then the Surface Unique Identifier is used 
      (tiles merge only if they share the same surface specification)
    The previous behavior ("MergeWith") was more flexible (though probably not meritoriously so), but also a lot more complex to configure.
      (MergeWith would Merge tiles of a particular surface type with anything from a specified list of surface IDs)

  Remove the forward vector calculation from the plotter (plot.js), convert it into a utility function, and place it in direction.js
    (for re-use with planar picking)
  Invert the interior NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, and WEST positioning & orientation data used by setOrientation() (direction.js)
    (Fixes an error that became evident after putting it to use for the first time)
  Add flags to loadMuch() and loadZIP() (libek.js) to indicate whether or not newly loaded objects should override existing objects.
  Add function "deepcopy" to util.js  ( recursively copies properties from a source object to a new object )
