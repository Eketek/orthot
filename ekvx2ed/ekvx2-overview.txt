ekvx2 format overview
"Eketech Voxel format, v2"

ekvx2 is a data format which is intended to support Orthot III and to do a better job exposing its features (both planned and current) than ekvx.  To that end, ekvx2 is a more generic format -- Just a JSON-serialized simple Object with two reserved properties and an inheritence-based compression scheme.

Ekvx2 data is a set of simple tables (each consisting solely of sets of key-value pairs) which can inherit from each othe (singular and non-circular).  Each table is called a "template".  If a template inherits from another template, the properties of the parent template are copied to the child template (or something functionally equivalent)

Templates and objects are stored separately (so they can be cleanly distinguished).


For Orthot version 3.0, the "base" template is presumed (determined by a type indicator).  At some future revision, it will require the inclusion of a base template (plan is to have all Orthot objects be of the same Type and to have all object behaviors specified through simple attributes.

Aside from the use of inheritence, there is no plan to incorporate data compression into ekvx2.  Instead, that will be deferred to the container (which is to be a file archive with a common format).
