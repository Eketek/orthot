This project is intended to be a re-implementation, extension, and Open-Sourcing of Orthot II.  A high level of compatibility is intended - puzzles built with Orthot II are to be loadable and playable in Orthot III (The data format to be retained, though the data from Orthot III editor is not expected to be backwards compatible).  This is also strictly a JavaScript and HTML project.

The previous version is a discontinued commercial project which has since been made available free of charge.  It may be found at this address:

Most of the game has successfully been implemented, though adding new puzzles requires the use of the level editor from previous version.
