  Rename terrain "decal" to "pattern" (every such variable/name/thing that belongs to the editor)
  Removed the random pattern selection from editor initialization.
  Simplify pattern specification:  It now uses number of rows and columns, and an X and Y tile position to define a fixed/default pattern
    (so far as editor/library/game logic is concerned, a "pattern" is only the relative/fractional size and position of a tile on a tilesheet)
  Moved pattern specification to from the abstract "Wall" tool specification to the individual variants.
  Apply patterns with the "box terrain definer" (same mechanism as is used to apply custom colors to terrain)
  Rename, move, and repurpose the "color.amount" field in the tool specification.  It now is "numSurfaceEntries" and applies to both colors and patterns 
    (and later, anything else that needs to be strongly associated with particular faces of a BoxTerrain cube)
  Internals for a pattern selection interface.
  Added logic for "merge classes" (ability to explicitly declare which defined surfaces the auto-texturing system should treat as merged)

9-11 Nov 2019
  Add starting position tool
  Add handling for object alignment'
  Add a "cam light" to the editor
  Various alterations & fixes to object positioning
  Add a Model specification to the application-specific editor configuration (working toward a common configuration system for both the editor and the application)
    colors/materials
    main model name (reference to the model to display)
    poses (for now, sets of mappings of names to model references)
  Add a coexistance check based on spatial classes.  If an object can not coexist with an existing object, the existing object gets replaced.
  Add support for unique objects
  Add horizontal alignment mode ("sane" orientation for things that are to be thought of as standing)
  Add a reset function 

8 Nov 2019
  Add a block-eraser tool
  Force a 3d cursor update after the "left-mouse-button-up" tool operation (immediate cursor updates in mouse-ray pickmode)

7 Nov 2019
  Reset mray pickmode memory on mouse release
  Add UI buttons to select the active tool.
  Gray color-buttons now update the "recent colors" list.

6 Nov 2019
  Tool specifications are now loaded from a JSON-formatted configuration file.
    (intent here is to mostly de-couple EkvxEd from Orthot, to make it a bit easier to turn it into a standalone volumetric layout and modelling tool)

15 Oct 2019 - 5 Nov 2019
  Initial development of EkvxEd2.
