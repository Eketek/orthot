      Orthot III<br>  
      Version: 0.3.0<br>

      <p>Orthot is a 3D puzzle in the "Excessive Internal Complexity" genre.</p>
      <p>
        Each puzzle is a separate challenge, the goal of which is to reach the marked exit point (Represented as a trasparent blue object with an "E" inside).
        Puzzles are built out of a collection of puzzle elements which you may interact with and which interact with each other.
        There are a wide variety of types of puzzles which you may encounter:
        Mazes, hidden object search, arrangement of blocks into particular patterns, logical problems, evasion of hostiles, or whatever else can be built out of
        interative blocks.  
      </p>        
      <p>
        It is the successor of Orthot II, which in turn was the successor of Orthot I.  
      </p>      
      <p>
        Orthot III is also an Open Source Project and is hosted on github:  
        <a href="https://github.com/Eketek/orthot">
          https://github.com/Eketek/orthot
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you would like to contribute, be be warned that the project is still somewhat more like a hastilly assembled mess of JavaScript than an elegantly
        coded and well-documented software project.  Eketek at least knows what to do about it.
